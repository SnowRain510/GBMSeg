We present GBMSeg, a training-free framework that automates the segmentation and measurement of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in TEM using only one-shot reference images. GBMSeg leverages the robust feature matching capabilities of pretrained foundation models (PFMs) to generate initial prompts, designs novel prompting engineering for optimized prompting methods, and utilizes a class-agnostic segmentation model to obtain the final segmentation result.
